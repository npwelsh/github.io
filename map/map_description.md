These power plants are located on the worlds larget geothermal field, with a nominal capacity of 1442.4 MW!  The area, which never contained any actual geysers, was formed 1.3 Ma years ago as a large body of slica rich magma forced its way up thought the fault in the Coastal Range of CA.  The 45-square-mile area contains hot springs that were known and used by the six bands of indigenous tribes:  three band of the Pomo, two of the Wappo, and a bankd of the Lake Miwok.
