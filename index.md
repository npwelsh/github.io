## About Me
Hi! My name is Nolan Welsh.  I am currently a Master's Student in Renewable Energy at CU Boulder. I am using my ten years of experience in geology and field engineering to renewable energy! Excited about emerging decarbonization technologies, new trends in power transmission and generation, geothermal for power generation as well heating and cooling, zero-carbon buildings and transportation, and solutions to make the energy transition work for everyone.

In my free time, I enjoy getting on my bike, poking around somewhere new backcountry skiing, or tinkering around with some new project at home. Always excited about learning new things!

## Maps 
### The Geyers Geothermal Field. Map of Powerplants Operated by the Calpine Corporation
This is a map of the Geysers Geothermal Area in California, highlighting the geothermal powerplants owned and operated by the Calpine Corporation.   These power plants are located on the worlds larget geothermal field, with a nominal capacity of 1442.4 MW!  The area, which never contained any actual geysers, was formed 1.3 Ma years ago as a large body of slica rich magma forced its way up thought the fault in the Coastal Range of CA.  The 45-square-mile area contains hot springs that were known and used by the six bands of indigenous tribes:  three band of the Pomo, two of the Wappo, and a bankd of the Lake Miwok.  The first geothermal plant was installed in 1921 to power a nearby resort.  Today, Calpine, PG&E, and two Electric Co-Ops operate powerplants in the field, with Calpine operating the majority in terms of number and power output. Red polygons below show the 16 power plants still in operation ownded by Calpine.
